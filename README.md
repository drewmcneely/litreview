# litreview

This is a repository for my literature review and bibliography.
I will be using biblatex, and have everything within a .bib file.
I am thinking of organizing this using tools from Nelson Beebe.

Entries should have the following fields:

* Keywords
    * Categorical Probability
    * Categorical controls
    * Geometric statistics
    * estimation
    * controls
* Notes
* ReadStatus
    * Unread
    * to read
    * Read
    * Reading
    * Reread
* ReadDate
* Usage
    * masters report
* Priority

## Workflows

### Adding an entry
### Modifying an entry
### Someone gives you a paper to read
### You find a paper you would like to read
### You start reading a paper
### You finish reading a paper
