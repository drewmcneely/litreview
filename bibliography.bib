  abstract =     "In medical image analysis and high level computer
                 vision, there is an intensive use of geometric features
                 like orientations, lines, and geometric transformations
                 ranging from simple ones (orientations, lines, rigid
                 body or affine transformations, etc.) to very complex
                 ones like curves, surfaces, or general diffeomorphic
                 transformations. The measurement of such geometric
                 primitives is generally noisy in real applications and
                 we need to use statistics either to reduce the
                 uncertainty (estimation), to compare observations, or
                 to test hypotheses. Unfortunately, even simple
                 geometric primitives often belong to manifolds that are
                 not vector spaces. In previous works [1, 2], we
                 investigated invariance requirements to build some
                 statistical tools on transformation groups and
                 homogeneous manifolds that avoids paradoxes. In this
                 paper, we consider finite dimensional manifolds with a
                 Riemannian metric as the basic structure. Based on this
                 metric, we develop the notions of mean value and
                 covariance matrix of a random element, normal law,
                 Mahalanobis distance and $\chi$2 law. We provide a new
                 proof of the characterization of Riemannian centers of
                 mass and an original gradient descent algorithm to
                 efficiently compute them. The notion of Normal law we
                 propose is based on the maximization of the entropy
                 knowing the mean and covariance of the distribution.
                 The resulting family of pdfs spans the whole range from
                 uniform (on compact manifolds) to the point mass
                 distribution. Moreover, we were able to provide
                 tractable approximations (with their limits) for small
                 variances which show that we can effectively implement
                 and work with these definitions.",

                 the computationally challenging problem of representing

                 of observations can be viewed as an example of Bayesian
                 filtering. The state vector describes the position and
                 velocity of the space object, and can be represented as
                 a 6-dimensional vector in Cartesian coordinates. The
                 observation vector consists of an angles-only
                 measurement, possibly plus range, a 2- or 3-
                 dimensional vector. Filtering is simplest if the joint
                 state and observation vectors follow a multivariate
                 normal distribution. However, even if the initial
                 uncertainty of the state is normally distributed, the
                 propagated orbital state several periods into the
                 future quickly becomes non-normal in ECI coordinates or
                 in various standard coordinate systems, with the
                 distribution of the position vector having a
                 distinctive ?banana? shape in R3. One solution to the
                 filtering problem is to use a particle filter, but this
                 approach can suffer from the curse of particle
                 depletion. Another solution is to switch to an ?adapted
                 structural? coordinate system, where the joint
                 distribution is much closer to normal. The phrase
                 ?adapted? means that the coordinate system depends on
                 the data. The key step is to note that the state vector
                 can also be described in terms of an ellipse (5 degrees
                 of freedom) plus the position of the space object along
                 the elliptical orbit (a one-dimensional angular or
                 directional variable, namely, the mean anomaly). In
                 particular, under idealized Keplerian dynamics, the
                 ellipse parameters are constant in time and the mean
                 anomaly is an angle traveling around a unit circle. In
                 this paper we demonstrate the usefulness, efficiency
                 and accuracy of this approach for the filtering
                 problem.",

                 Space Object (RSO). Without information that uniquely
                 assigns the measurement to a particular RSO there can
                 be no certainty on the identity of the object. It could
                 be that the measurement was produced by clutter or
                 perhaps a newly birthed RSO. It is also a possibility
                 that the measurement came from a previously known
                 object that maneuvered away from its predicted
                 location. Typically, tracking methods tend to associate
                 uncorrelated measurements to new objects and wait for
                 more information to determine the true RSO population.
                 This can lead to the loss of object custody. The goal

  abstract =     "Maintaining a catalog of Resident Space Objects (RSOs)
                 can be cast in a typical Bayesian multi-object
                 estimation problem, where the various sources of
                 uncertainty in the problem – the orbital mechanics,
                 the kinematic states of the identified objects, the
                 data sources, etc. – are modeled as random variables
                 with associated probability distributions. In the
                 context of Space Situational Awareness, however, the
                 information available to a space analyst on many
                 uncertain components is scarce, preventing their
                 appropriate modeling with a random variable and thus
                 their exploitation in a RSO tracking algorithm. A
                 typical example are human-based data sources such as
                 Two-Line Elements (TLEs), which are publicly available
                 but lack any statistical description of their accuracy.
                 In this paper, we propose the first exploitation of
                 uncertain variables in a RSO tracking problem, allowing
                 for a representation of the uncertain components
                 reflecting the information available to the space
                 analyst, however scarce, and nothing more. In
                 particular, we show that a human-based data source and
                 a physics-based data source can be embedded in a
                 unified and rigorous Bayesian estimator in order to
                 track a RSO. We illustrate this concept on a scenario
                 where real TLEs queried from the U.S. Strategic Command
                 are fused with realistically simulated radar
                 observations in order to track a Low-Earth Orbit
                 satellite.",

                 Object (RSO) detection and tracking algorithm is the
                 scarcity of available information on the various
                 sources of uncertainty in the underlying estimation
                 problem, such as the orbital mechanics or the data
                 sources producing the observations. Some of these
                 uncertain components lack statistical description, such

  abstract =     "Uncertainty propagation of dynamical systems is a
                 common need across many domains and disciplines. In
                 nonlinear settings, the extended Kalman filter is the
                 de facto standard propagation tool. Recently, a new
                 class of propagation methods called sigma-point Kalman
                 filters was introduced, which eliminated the need for
                 explicit computation of tangent linear matrices. It has
                 been shown in numerous cases that the actual
                 uncertainty of a dynamical system cannot be accurately
                 described by a Gaussian probability density function.
                 This has motivated work in applying the Gaussian
                 mixture model approach to better approximate the
                 non-Gaussian probability density function. A limitation
                 to existing approaches is that the number of Gaussian
                 components of the Gaussian mixture model is fixed
                 throughout the propagation of uncertainty. This
                 limitation has made previous work ill-suited for
                 nonstationary probability density functions either due
                 to inaccurate representation of the probability density
                 function or computational burden given a large number
                 of Gaussian components that may not be needed. This
                 work examines an improved method implementing a
                 Gaussian mixture model that is adapted online via
                 splitting of the Gaussian mixture model components
                 triggered by an entropy-based detection of nonlinearity
                 during the probability density function evolution. In
                 doing so, the Gaussian mixture model approximation
                 adaptively includes additional components as
                 nonlinearity is encountered and can therefore be used
                 to more accurately approximate the probability density
                 function. This paper introduces this strategy, called
                 adaptive entropy-based Gaussian-mixture information
                 synthesis. The adaptive entropy-based Gaussian-mixture
                 information synthesis method is demonstrated for its
                 ability to accurately perform inference on two cases of
                 uncertain orbital dynamical systems. The impact of this
                 work for orbital dynamical systems is that the improved
                 representation of the uncertainty of the space object
                 can then be used more consistently for identification
                 and tracking.",

                 the research community. Most UKFs work only with
                 Euclidean systems, but in many scenarios it is
                 advantageous to consider systems with state-variables
                 taking values on Riemannian manifolds. However, we can
                 still find some gaps in the literature's theory of UKFs
                 for Riemannian systems: for instance, the literature
                 has not yet developed first, Riemannian extensions of
                 some fundamental concepts of the UKF theory (e.g.,
                 extensions of σ-representation, unscented
                 transformation, additive UKF, augmented UKF,
                 additive-noise system), second, proofs of some steps in
                 their UKFs for Riemannian systems (e.g., proof of sigma
                 points parameterization by vectors, state correction
                 equations, noise statistics inclusion), and third,
                 relations between their UKFs for Riemannian systems. In
                 this paper, we attempt to develop a theory capable of
                 filling these gaps. Among other results, we propose
                 Riemannian extensions of the main concepts in the UKF
                 theory (including closed forms), justify all steps of
                 the proposed UKFs, and provide a framework able to
                 relate UKFs for particular manifolds among themselves
                 and with UKFs for Euclidean spaces. Compared with UKFs
                 for Riemannian manifolds of the literature, the
                 proposed filters are more consistent, formally
                 principled, and general. An example of satellite
                 attitude tracking illustrates the proposed theory.",

                 especially the relations between meteoroid streams,
                 comets and asteroids (possibly extinct comets), remains
                 one of the important problems in Solar system
                 astronomy. Different criteria, starting with one by
                 Southworth and Hawkins, have been used for this
                 purpose. Ideally, they must represent some kind of
                 metric in a five-dimensional space of orbits.
                 Unfortunately, they are not ideal. The majority of the
                 criteria have been examined by us. It turns out that
                 they all represent pseudometrics for which the triangle
                 axiom is not fulfilled. Besides this, they are
                 inapplicable if at least one of the orbits is circular.
                 We propose metrics free of all the aforementioned
                 drawbacks. In addition, the metric properties of three
                 factor-spaces, where orbits are identified irrespective
                 of the values of node longitudes, pericentre arguments
                 or both, are examined. The results are applied to the
                 problem of searching for minor bodies of the Solar
                 system with a common origin. The relationship between
                 comet 96P/Machholz 1 and asteroid 2003EH1, as well as
                 that between comet 2P/Encke and asteroid 2004TG10, has
                 been proved. Using all criteria considered and the new
                 metrics leads to practically identical results. This is
                 explained by the fact that only close and essentially
                 non-circular orbits were analysed. Besides this, the
                 measure of orbit triples for which the triangle axiom
                 failed is likely small, though this problem has not
                 been examined yet.}",

  abstract =     "There are many Resident Space Objects (RSOs) in the
                 Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) regime, both
                 operational and debris. The primary non-gravitational
                 force acting on these RSOs is Solar Radiation Pressure
                 (SRP), which is sensitive to the RSO’s area-to-mass
                 ratio. Sparse observation data and mismodeling of
                 non-gravitational forces has constrained the state of
                 practice in tracking and characterizing RSOs. Accurate
                 identification, characterization, tracking, and motion
                 prediction of RSOs is a high priority research issue as
                 it shall aid in assessing collision probabilities in
                 the GEO regime, and orbital safety writ large. Previous
                 work in characterizing RSOs has taken a preliminary
                 step in exploiting fused astrometric and photometric
                 data to estimate the RSO mass, shape, attitude, and
                 size. This works, in theory, since angles data are
                 sensitive to SRP albedo-area-to-mass ratio, and
                 photometric data are sensitive to shape, attitude, and
                 observed albedo-area. By fusing these two data types,
                 mass and albedo-area both become observable parameters
                 and can be estimated as independent quantities.
                 However, previous work in mass and albedo-area
                 estimation has not quantified and assessed the
                 fundamental physical link between SRP albedo-area and
                 observed albedo-area. The observed albedo-area is
                 always a function of the SRP albedo-area along the line
                 of sight of the observer. This is the physical
                 relationship that this current research exploits. It is
                 shown through simulation that due to this physical
                 link, and through the fusion of astrometric and
                 photometric data, it is possible to observe the mass of
                 a space object when the area is not known. Results for
                 data from 100 trajectories generated from randomly
                 sampled initial conditions are shown. It is seen that
                 even when the area of the object is not known, the
                 uncertainty in mass can be lowered from an initial
                 value of 800 kg to the range 500–700 kg for 72%
                 of the samples, 200–500 kg for 13% of the samples,
                 and 0–200 kg for 15% of the samples. It is further
                 shown that although the uncertainties are large, the
                 actual errors in mass are much lower, with the error
                 RMS being less than 100 kg for 30% of the samples,
                 between 100 and 200 kg for another 30%, and between
                 200 and 300 kg for 24% of the samples.",

  abstract =     "A new method for predicting the uncertainty in a
                 nonlinear dynamical system is developed and analyzed in
                 the context of uncertainty evolution for resident space
                 objects (RSOs) in the near-geosynchronous orbit regime
                 under the influence of central body gravitational
                 acceleration, third body perturbations, and
                 attitude-dependent solar radiation pressure (SRP)
                 accelerations and torques. The new method, termed the
                 splitting Gaussian mixture unscented Kalman filter
                 (SGMUKF), exploits properties of the differential
                 entropy or Rényi entropy for a linearized dynamical
                 system to determine when a higher-order prediction of
                 uncertainty reaches a level of disagreement with a
                 first-order prediction, and then applies a multivariate
                 Gaussian splitting algorithm to reduce the impact of
                 induced nonlinearity. In order to address the relative
                 accuracy of the new method with respect to the more
                 traditional approaches of the extended Kalman filter
                 (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF), several
                 concepts regarding the comparison of probability
                 density functions (pdfs) are introduced and utilized in
                 the analysis. The research also describes high-fidelity
                 modeling of the nonlinear dynamical system which drives
                 the motion of an RSO, and includes models for
                 evaluation of the central body gravitational
                 acceleration, the gravitational acceleration due to
                 other celestial bodies, and attitude-dependent SRP
                 accelerations and torques when employing a macro plate
                 model of an RSO. Furthermore, a high-fidelity model of
                 the measurement of the line-of-sight of a spacecraft
                 from a ground station is presented, which applies
                 light-time and stellar aberration corrections, and
                 accounts for observer and target lighting conditions,
                 as well as for the sensor field of view. The developed
                 algorithms are applied to the problem of forward
                 predicting the time evolution of the region of
                 uncertainty for RSO tracking, and uncertainty
                 rectification via the fusion of incoming measurement
                 data with prior knowledge. It is demonstrated that the
                 SGMUKF method is significantly better able to forward
                 predict the region of uncertainty and is subsequently
                 better able to utilize new measurement data.",

                 of vector calculus, differential geometry and related
                 subjects in applied mathematics. This text invites its
                 audience to take a fresh look at previously learned
                 material through the prism of tensor calculus. Once the
                 framework is mastered, the student is introduced to new
                 material which includes differential geometry on
                 manifolds, shape optimization, boundary perturbation,
                 and dynamic fluid film equations. Tensor calculus is a
                 powerful tool that combines the geometric and
                 analytical perspectives and enables us to take full
                 advantage of the computational utility of coordinate
                 systems. The tensor approach can be of benefit to
                 members of all technical sciences including mathematics
                 and all engineering disciplines. If calculus and linear
                 algebra are central to the readers scientific
                 endeavors, tensor calculus is indispensable. The
                 language of tensors, originally championed by Einstein,
                 is as fundamental as the languages of calculus and
                 linear algebra and is one that every technical
                 scientist ought to speak. The tensor technique,
                 invented at the turn of the 20th century, is now
                 considered classical. Yet, as the author shows, it
                 remains remarkably vital and relevant. The authors
                 skilled lecturing capabilities are evident by the
                 inclusion of insightful examples and a plethora of
                 exercises. A great deal of material is devoted to the
                 geometric fundamentals, the mechanics of change of
                 variables, the proper use of the tensor notation, and
                 the discussion of the interplay between algebra and
                 geometry. The early chapters have many words and few
                 equations. The definition of a tensor comes only in
                 Chapter 6 when the reader is ready for it. While this
                 text maintains a reasonable level of rigor, it takes
                 great care to avoid formalizing the subject.",

                 modeled as deformations of a reference shape, i.e., as
                 elements of a Lie group. To analyze the variability of
                 the human anatomy in this framework, we need to perform
                 statistics on Lie groups. A Lie group is a manifold
                 with a consistent group structure. Statistics on
                 Riemannian manifolds have been well studied, but to use
                 the statistical Riemannian framework on Lie groups, one
                 needs to define a Riemannian metric compatible with the
                 group structure: a bi-invariant metric. However, it is
                 known that Lie groups, which are not a direct product
                 of compact and abelian groups, have no bi-invariant
                 metric. However, what about bi-invariant
                 pseudo-metrics? In other words: could we remove the
                 assumption of the positivity of the metric and obtain
                 consistent statistics on Lie groups through the
                 pseudo-Riemannian framework? Our contribution is
                 two-fold. First, we present an algorithm that
                 constructs bi-invariant pseudo-metrics on a given Lie
                 group, in the case of existence. Then, by running the
                 algorithm on commonly-used Lie groups, we show that
                 most of them do not admit any bi-invariant (pseudo-)
                 metric. We thus conclude that the (pseudo-) Riemannian
                 setting is too limited for the definition of consistent
                 statistics on general Lie groups.",

                 recognition applications where the underlying models
                 have a special structure-the linear subspace structure.
                 We discuss how commonly used parametric models for
                 videos and image sets can be described using the
                 unified framework of Grassmann and Stiefel manifolds.
                 We first show that the parameters of linear dynamic
                 models are finite-dimensional linear subspaces of
                 appropriate dimensions. Unordered image sets as samples
                 from a finite-dimensional linear subspace naturally
                 fall under this framework. We show that an inference
                 over subspaces can be naturally cast as an inference
                 problem on the Grassmann manifold. To perform
                 recognition using subspace-based models, we need tools
                 from the Riemannian geometry of the Grassmann manifold.
                 This involves a study of the geometric properties of
                 the space, appropriate definitions of Riemannian
                 metrics, and definition of geodesics. Further, we
                 derive statistical modeling of inter and intraclass
                 variations that respect the geometry of the space. We
                 apply techniques such as intrinsic and extrinsic
                 statistics to enable maximum-likelihood classification.
                 We also provide algorithms for unsupervised clustering
                 derived from the geometry of the manifold. Finally, we
                 demonstrate the improved performance of these methods

                 activity recognition, video-based face recognition,

                 statically-typed, purelyfunctional programming

                 probability distributions in embedded languages,

                 language in a way that is amenable to inference, and
